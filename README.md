# Swagger issue

This example showcases the unreliable behavior of the following [go-swagger issue](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger/issues/2066).

Run `make install` to install the dependencies.

Then run `make` a bunch of times to reproduce the issue.

Without make you can run the commands as defined in `make reproduce` and `make generate` manually from the terminal.
